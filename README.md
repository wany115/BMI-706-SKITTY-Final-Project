# BMI-706-SKITTY-Final-Project
This is the repo for submission of BMI 706 Final Project from Group SKITTY. 

## Raw Data
We store it as the compressed ZIP file. We appreciate John Hopkins University and World Bank for providing the data. 

- COVID-19 Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/okwirjulius/covid19-cases-in-africa/data?select=covid19_world.csv
- World Bank Health Nutrition and Population Statistics: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics#

## Code
The folder contains four major codes we used: 
- Data_wrangling: Created by Yuan;  allows us to obtain clean data csv files provided in the data directory
- streamlit_part1: Created by Dailin; allows visualization for COVID-19 times series data across countries
- streamlit_part2: Created by Wanyue; allows visualization for associations between COVID-19 annual data and socioeconomic factors
- streamlit_final: Created by all three of us; allows us to get the final streamlit app that combines Part1 and Part2 functions.

## Cleaned Data
Allow us to depart directly from clean data!
